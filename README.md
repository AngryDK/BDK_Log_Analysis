Hello,

  My name is Ã‚ngryDK and this is a script used to gather useful information about a players Death Strike habits.
  You'll need a API key from your https://www.warcraftlogs.com/profile page. At the very bottom is a API section.
  You'll want to name it and get a v1 API code.

  Once you have this, edit the hidden file `.env` to apply this.

  Next, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to gather the libraries needed to run the script.

  At the time, this has been tested on both Windows and Linux so if there are any issues please let me know.

  Also, big shout out to Biceppumps for creating the original version of this script. Without his code I wouldn't have been able to create this.
  Big thanks to Kyrasis for sharing this with me too!
